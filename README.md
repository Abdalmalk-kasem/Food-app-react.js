# Redux Cart Application

## Overview

I took on the role of a solo developer to create a feature-rich Redux Cart application using React, CSS, Redux, and Redux Toolkit. The primary goal of this project was to showcase my expertise in frontend development, state management with Redux, and integration with Firebase Realtime Database for persistent cart data.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS for styling and layout
- Firebase Realtime Database for cart data storage

## Features

1. **Shopping Cart Functionality:**
   - Implemented a dynamic shopping cart that allows users to add and remove items.
   - Cart state managed efficiently using Redux and Redux Toolkit.

2. **User Authentication:**
   - Integrated Firebase authentication to enhance user interactions.
   - Ensured persistent cart data storage for authenticated users.

3. **Real-time Updates:**
   - Utilized Firebase Realtime Database to provide instant updates on cart status.
   - Synchronized user cart data across different sessions.
